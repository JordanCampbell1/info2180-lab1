        <p>I’m interested in web development because it’s a practical way to build things that people can use. I like the challenge of making websites look good and work well. The web is always changing, which keeps it interesting and pushes me to keep learning new skills. I also enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life through coding and solving problems along the way.</p>
